abstract: >
  Hybrid knowledge-grounded procedural quest generation for Wizard101 using large language
  models. Compares a schema-only Baseline with an Advanced pipeline that adds structured
  indexes, retrieval-augmented grounding over lore, and explicit planning, producing
  schema-valid quest JSON. Includes artefacts for reproducibility.
