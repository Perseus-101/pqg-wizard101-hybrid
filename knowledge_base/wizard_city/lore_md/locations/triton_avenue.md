### **Description & Atmosphere**

Triton Avenue is a street perpetually caught in a magical thunderstorm, reflecting its connection to the School of Storm. Canals of churning water run alongside the main path, and the sky is a constant, gloomy grey. The central landmark is the large, water-powered Four Falls Mill. The atmosphere is oppressive and dangerous, with the constant rain and the presence of patrolling undead creating a sense of unease and peril.

### **First Arc Story Relevance**

Triton Avenue represents a significant escalation in the undead threat. The street is not just haunted; it is occupied by an organized force of undead and their cyclops allies. The main questline, initiated by the worried student Artur Gryphonbane, involves rescuing his sister Suzie from the clutches of the formidable Sergeant Skull-splitter. The player must also contend with the ambitious and untrustworthy Death student, Duncan Grimwater, and defeat the powerful Cyclops, Foulgaze, to clear the way. The story of Triton Avenue demonstrates that Malistaire's forces are not just a random plague but a coordinated army with officers and strategic alliances, raising the stakes for the young wizard.
