# **Location Lore File: Olde Town**

Location: Olde Town  
World: Wizard City  
Primary NPCs: Sergeant Muldoon, Gloria Krendell  
Primary Mobs: None

### **Description & Atmosphere**

Olde Town serves as the crucial buffer zone between the safe, central areas of Wizard City and the monster-infested streets beyond. It has an older, more residential feel than The Commons, with charming, slightly worn buildings and a large, central fountain. However, the atmosphere is one of caution and tension. The presence of the gruff Sergeant Muldoon and his guards at the gates to the outer streets makes it clear that this is the frontline. It's a place of transition, where the safety of the city proper ends and the adventure truly begins.

### **First Arc Story Relevance**

Olde Town is the narrative launchpad for the main conflict. After the initial introductions, Headmaster Ambrose sends the player here to speak with Sergeant Muldoon, who officially tasks them with investigating the disturbances on Triton Avenue, Firecat Alley, and Cyclops Lane. This makes Olde Town the point where the story shifts from learning to action. Furthermore, it is the home of Gloria Krendell, the keeper of Sylvia Drake's memories. The quest she provides is a pivotal moment, giving the player their first glimpse into Malistaire's tragic motivations. Olde Town is therefore essential, acting as both the physical gateway to danger and the narrative gateway to the deeper story.
