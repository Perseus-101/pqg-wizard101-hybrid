Firecat Alley is a scorching, volcanic-themed street that embodies the raw power of the School of Fire. The ground is scorched earth, pools of bubbling lava dot the landscape, and the air shimmers with intense heat.

### **First Arc Story Relevance**

The story of Firecat Alley centers on a magical plague. The Fire Elves, once a noble race, have been twisted by a curse into aggressive, monstrous versions of their former selves. The player is tasked by the outmatched Private Quinn to help, which leads them to Prince Alicane Swiftarrow. The prince reveals the plight of his people and asks the player to help him create a cure. This quest involves dealing with the treacherous witch Gretta Darkkettle and ultimately confronting the powerful necromancer Bastilla Gravewynd, the mastermind behind the curse. This arc is significant as it shows the deep and insidious nature of Malistaire's influence, capable of corrupting an entire race, and solidifies the player's role as a liberator and a healer.
