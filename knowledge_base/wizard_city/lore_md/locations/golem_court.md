### **Description & Atmosphere**

Golem Court is a small, quiet, and secluded courtyard tucked away from the main thoroughfares of Wizard City. It is dominated by the imposing Golem Tower, a structure used for student trials. The atmosphere is one of quiet study and powerful, contained magic. It feels less like a public space and more like a private training ground for serious wizards. It is also the residence of Malorn Ashthorn, the substitute Death professor, which adds to its somber and slightly isolated feel.

### **First Arc Story Relevance**

Golem Court's primary relevance in the first arc is tied to the player's academic progression. At level 5, every student, regardless of their school, is sent to the Golem Tower for a personal quest from their professor. Inside, they must face magical Golem constructs to prove their worth and earn their first new spell. This makes a visit to Golem Court a mandatory rite of passage for all young wizards. For students of the Death school, it holds additional importance as the place where they receive their initial training from Malorn Ashthorn before the true School of Death is rediscovered in Nightside.
