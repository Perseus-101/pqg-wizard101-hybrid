### **Description & Atmosphere**

Unicorn Way was once a beautiful street, embodying the serenity of the Life School with its lush park and intricate hedge maze. However, when the player arrives, it is shrouded in a gloomy, purple haze. The trees are twisted, the air is heavy with dark magic, and the once-peaceful fairies have become aggressive. The atmosphere is one of beauty corrupted, a paradise lost. It is also home to the Dueling Arena, where wizards can test their skills against one another under the watchful eye of Diego the Duelmaster.

### **First Arc Story Relevance**

Unicorn Way serves as the player's introduction to combat and the tangible effects of Malistaire's evil. The main questline here is a self-contained story arc that sets the template for future streets. The player is tasked by the overwhelmed Private Connelly and the concerned student Ceren Nightchant to investigate the source of the corruption. This leads them to the weakened Fairy Queen, Lady Oriel, who reveals that the necromancer Lady Blackhope is responsible. The player must defeat both the notorious Rattlebones and Lady Blackhope to lift the curse and restore peace. This questline is crucial as it establishes the player as a capable hero and demonstrates that Malistaire's influence is not just a distant threat, but a direct and corrupting force upon the innocent inhabitants of the Spiral.
