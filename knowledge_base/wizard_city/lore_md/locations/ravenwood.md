### **Description & Atmosphere**

Ravenwood is the serene and magical campus of the Ravenwood School of Magical Arts. The entire area is organized around the colossal, ancient Grandfather Tree, Bartleby, whose gentle, sleeping face is a constant, reassuring presence. Each of the seven main schools of magic has its own dedicated area, with architecture and flora that reflect its specific elemental themeâ€”from the fiery volcanoes of the Fire School to the tranquil waterfalls of the Life School. The atmosphere is one of focused learning and profound magic, a peaceful academic sanctuary where students train to become masters of the Spiral.

### **First Arc Story Relevance**

Ravenwood's primary role in the first arc is to be the center of the player's magical education. After being accepted as a student, the player meets their chosen school's professor here, who will grant them new spells as they level up. The most significant story element in Ravenwood is Bartleby. He is not just a tree, but a primordial being whose health is tied to the health of the Spiral itself. Malistaire's theft of his "Eye of History" is a critical plot point, as Bartleby is the one who reveals that Malistaire seeks the Krokonomicon. Ravenwood serves as the player's home base, the source of their power, and the home of the ancient being who holds the key to understanding the villain's ultimate plan.
