### **Description & Atmosphere**

Nightside is a hidden, subterranean realm perpetually shrouded in twilight. It is the physical embodiment of Death magicâ€”gloomy, melancholic, and filled with tombstones, wandering spirits, and dark caverns. The atmosphere is somber and oppressive, but also strangely peaceful, like a quiet graveyard. It is home to the ancient Death Tree, Mortis, the Sunken City, and, most importantly, the lost School of Death, which was ripped from the Ravenwood campus by Malistaire.

### **First Arc Story Relevance**

Nightside's relevance is twofold. First, it is the home of the School of Death. After the player proves their worth by defeating Lord Nightshade, Headmaster Ambrose reveals the truth about the missing school and sends the player to find it. Here, they meet the timid Professor Dworgyn and the ancient tree Mortis, completing the roster of Ravenwood's schools. Second, Nightside contains the Dark Cave, the final instance of the Wizard City main questline. It is the place where the story's central mystery is finally explained, making it the narrative capstone of the entire arc.
