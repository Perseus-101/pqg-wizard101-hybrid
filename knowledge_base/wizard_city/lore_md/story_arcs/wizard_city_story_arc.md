# Wizard City Story Arc: Securing the Streets (Final Version)

### Overarching Goal
To restore order and safety to the main streets of Wizard City, which have been thrown into chaos by Malistaire Drake's top lieutenants. The player must investigate the disturbances on each street and defeat the local antagonist to make the areas safe for residents again.

### Key Antagonists
- **Rattlebones:** An undead wizard and the initial threat on Unicorn Way.
- **General Akilles:** A tyrannical Cyclops warlord who has occupied Cyclops Lane with his army.
- **Lord Nightshade:** A powerful wraith and one of Malistaire's most important commanders, who has taken over Triton Avenue.

### Plot Progression
1.  **The Task from Ambrose:** After the player proves their basic skills, Headmaster Merle Ambrose tasks them with a greater challenge. He is deeply concerned about the escalating chaos on Unicorn Way, Cyclops Lane, Firecat Alley, and Triton Avenue, and asks the player to help restore peace.

2.  **Cleansing Unicorn Way:** The player first travels to Unicorn Way and finds it shrouded in a dark curse. They work with Lady Oriel to investigate the source, culminating in a confrontation with Rattlebones in his tower, whose defeat cleanses the street of its primary curse.

3.  **Taming Firecat Alley:** The player investigates the source of the unnatural fires plaguing Firecat Alley. They assist the local residents and guards by quelling the aggressive Fire Elves and extinguishing magical fires, restoring a semblance of order to the alley.

4.  **Liberating Cyclops Lane:** Next, the player finds Cyclops Lane under the martial law of General Akilles and his Cyclops army. The player must assist the local resistance by sabotaging the army's efforts and defeating its champions, which ends when the player confronts and defeats General Akilles.

5.  **Haunting of Triton Avenue:** The player moves to the final street, Triton Avenue, finding it overrun with legions of ghosts and other undead. The goal here is to fight back the immediate haunted threat on the street itself.

6.  **Discovering Nightside:** During the investigation on Triton Avenue, the player learns that the source of the undead is not on the street itself. They are led to a hidden passage, the Dark Cave, which opens into the gloomy, subterranean area of Nightside.

7.  **Climax in Stormdrain Tower:** Within Nightside, the player locates Stormdrain Tower, the main hideout of Lord Nightshade. The player ascends the tower and confronts him in a final battle to end his reign of terror over Wizard City.

### Outcome
With the defeat of all three lieutenants, the immediate threats are neutralized, and the streets of Wizard City are made safe. Headmaster Ambrose congratulates the player, recognizing them as a true hero and a powerful wizard. However, the victory is bittersweet, as it is revealed that this entire series of attacks was merely a diversion. The chaos kept the faculty of Ravenwood occupied while Malistaire Drake furthered his true, more sinister plans elsewhere, setting the stage for the next major story arc involving Krokotopia.
