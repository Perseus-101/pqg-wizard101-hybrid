# **Lore File: Nolan Stormgate**

Name: Nolan Stormgate  
Role: Quest Giver  
Location: Cyclops Lane

### **Personality**

Nolan Stormgate is a responsible and deeply concerned student. He is not a powerful warrior, but a loyal friend who is overwhelmed by the danger that has befallen his classmates. He is brave enough to venture to the edge of the occupied territory but wise enough to know he cannot face a cyclops army alone. He places his trust in the player, acting as a worried but hopeful guide who initiates the quest to save the lane.

### **First Arc Backstory & Lore**

Nolan's role in the story is to be the narrative catalyst for the Cyclops Lane arc. His friends have been captured by General Akilles's invading army, and he is the one who meets the player at the entrance to the street to plead for their help. He provides the initial exposition, explaining the situation and setting the stakes. He represents the innocent students caught in the crossfire of the larger conflict, and his quest gives the player a clear, personal reason to fight: to rescue his friends and restore safety to their home.
