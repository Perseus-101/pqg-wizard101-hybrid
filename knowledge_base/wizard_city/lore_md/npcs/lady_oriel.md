# **Lore File: Lady Oriel**

Name: Lady Oriel  
Role: Fairy Queen & Quest Giver  
Location: Unicorn Way, Hedge Maze

### **Personality**

As the Fairy Queen, Lady Oriel is regal, graceful, and speaks with a gentle authority. Her primary emotion when the player meets her is a deep, sorrowful worry for her subjects, the fairies, who have been twisted by dark magic. She is immensely grateful for the player's intervention, viewing the young wizard as a beacon of hope in her darkest hour.

### **First Arc Backstory & Lore**

Lady Oriel's story is the first major crisis the player must solve in Wizard City. Her domain, the once-peaceful Unicorn Way, has been corrupted by the necromancer **Lady Blackhope**. The fairies, once gentle spirits of life, have been turned into aggressive Dark Fairies.

Lady Oriel herself has been weakened and trapped within her Hedge Maze by this dark magic, unable to help her people directly. Her questline tasks the player with fighting back against the undead infesting the street, discovering the source of the corruption, and ultimately defeating Lady Blackhope to lift the curse. Her plight establishes the player's role as a hero and demonstrates the tangible effects of Malistaire's influence on the innocent inhabitants of the Spiral.
