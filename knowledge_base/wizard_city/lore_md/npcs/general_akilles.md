# **Lore File: General Akilles**

Name: General Akilles  
Role: Boss of Cyclops Lane  
Location: Cyclops Lane, Festival Park

### **Personality**

General Akilles is a unique antagonist in the first arc. He is not malicious or driven by a lust for power. Instead, he is a disciplined military leader who operates under a strict, if simple, code of honor. He is proud, powerful, and bound by his duty to follow the orders he was given. He respects strength and views combat as a matter of honor. While he is an obstacle, he is a noble one, and he will concede defeat gracefully if bested in a fair duel.

### **First Arc Backstory & Lore**

General Akilles and his army of cyclopes have invaded and occupied Cyclops Lane, capturing several Ravenwood students in the process. He is not allied with the undead out of a shared ideology, but rather as part of a strategic alliance or a command from a higher, unseen authority connected to Malistaire.

His role in the story is to present the player with a different kind of challenge. Unlike the mindless undead or the cruel necromancers, the player cannot simply vanquish Akilles. They must prove their worthiness by fighting through his disciplined army of Legionnaires and Enforcers. The final confrontation is a formal duel for the freedom of the captured students and the liberation of the lane. Defeating him teaches the player an important lesson: not all who stand in their way are inherently evil, and some conflicts are resolved through honor and mutual respect for strength.
