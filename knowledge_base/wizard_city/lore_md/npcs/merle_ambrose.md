He is a natural mentor, guiding young wizards with encouragement and profound wisdom, seeing the potential in every student who walks through his door.

### **First Arc Backstory & Lore**

Merle Ambrose's role in the first arc is that of the player's primary guide and the central authority figure in Wizard City. As the founder and Headmaster of Ravenwood, he is responsible for the education of young wizards and the protection of the city from magical threats.

His backstory is deeply intertwined with the main antagonist, Malistaire Drake. Ambrose was not only the Headmaster but also the personal mentor to both Malistaire and his brother, Cyrus. He recognized Malistaire's prodigious talent but was ultimately unable to prevent his descent into darkness following the death of his wife, Sylvia.

Throughout the first arc, Ambrose's history with Malistaire informs his actions. He is the one who reveals the initial threat, explaining that his former star pupil has gone rogue. He tasks the player with investigating the disturbances on the city's streets, acting as a quest hub and a source of crucial information. His quests are designed to test the player's growing abilities while systematically uncovering the extent of Malistaire's plan. He directs the player to speak with key figures, solve the problems on each street, and ultimately confront Malistaire's lieutenants. His deep knowledge of the Spiral and its history makes him the only one who truly understands the danger Malistaire poses, setting the stage for the entire arc's conflict.
