# **Lore File: Cyrus Drake**

Name: Cyrus Drake  
Role: Professor of the School of Myth  
Location: Ravenwood, School of Myth

### **Personality**

Cyrus Drake is defined by his perpetually unimpressed, cynical, and sarcastic nature. He is a brilliant and demanding teacher who believes in pushing his students to their absolute limits, often through harsh criticism and seemingly impossible tasks. He has little patience for incompetence and views most new wizards as "fledglings" who are likely to fail. Beneath this abrasive exterior, however, lies a deep-seated pain and a well-hidden, genuine concern for the safety of Ravenwood. His sarcasm is a shield, protecting a complex character burdened by his family's dark turn.

### **First Arc Backstory & Lore**

Cyrus Drake's backstory is one of the most critical narrative threads in the first arc. He is the brother of Malistaire Drake, the game's primary antagonist. This familial tie places him in a unique and difficult position. While fiercely loyal to Ravenwood and Headmaster Ambrose, he is constantly living in the shadow of his brother's betrayal.

Throughout the Wizard City quests, Cyrus provides a crucial, alternative perspective on the conflict. Unlike Ambrose's more compassionate view, Cyrus's interactions are tinged with bitterness and a personal sense of shame. He often expresses disdain for Malistaire's actions, yet there's an underlying sense of frustration and perhaps even a hint of sympathy for the brother he lost to grief.

His quests are often framed as burdensome chores he'd rather not deal with, such as demanding the player clean up the mess on Cyclops Lane. This is his way of testing the student's resolve. His personality makes his rare moments of approval all the more meaningful. Defeating General Akilles and restoring order to Cyclops Lane is a key moment where the player begins to earn a sliver of his respect, proving they are more than just another "fledgling." His backstory provides a necessary layer of personal conflict and emotional depth to the otherwise straightforward "good vs. evil" narrative.
