# **Lore File: Rattlebones**

Name: Rattlebones  
Role: First Boss  
Location: Unicorn Way, Rattlebones' Tower

### **Personality**

Rattlebones is an arrogant and boastful skeletal necromancer. Despite being one of the first significant threats a wizard faces, he carries himself with the confidence of a much more powerful villain. He taunts the player, underestimating their abilities and delighting in his own minor villainy. He is a classic "first boss" character, designed to be a memorable and slightly comical introduction to the world of evil masterminds.

### **First Arc Backstory & Lore**

Rattlebones is a notorious undead lieutenant in Malistaire's army. While Lady Blackhope is corrupting the street, Rattlebones has established his own base of operations in a tower just off Unicorn Way. He is a known troublemaker, and Headmaster Ambrose tasks the player with defeating him as one of their very first missions.

His role in the story is crucial: he is the gatekeeper. Defeating him serves as the player's first major test, proving to Ambrose and to themselves that they are capable of facing the dangers ahead. While not as central to the plot as Lord Nightshade, his defeat is a mandatory rite of passage, a first victory that builds the player's confidence and reputation as a promising young hero.
